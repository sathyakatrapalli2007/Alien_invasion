# 🚀 Alien Invasion

A 2D arcade-style space shooter built using **Python** and **Pygame**, based on the *Alien Invasion* project from *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes.

This version extends the original game by adding a **real-time adaptive difficulty system**, making gameplay more dynamic and responsive to player performance.

---

## 🎮 Overview

The player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and must eliminate a fleet of descending aliens.

Unlike the base version, this game:

* Adapts difficulty in real time
* Responds to player accuracy
* Maintains a balanced challenge

---

## ✨ Features

### Core Gameplay

* Ship movement with keyboard controls
* Bullet firing system
* Alien fleet generation and movement
* Collision detection (bullets, aliens, ship)
* Score tracking and high score system
* Limited lives and game-over condition

---

### 🧠 Adaptive Difficulty System (Custom Feature)

This game includes a **two-level adaptive difficulty system**:

#### 1. 📊 Cross-Game Adaptation (Persistent)

* Stores performance from the last **4–5 games**
* Calculates average accuracy
* Sets **initial alien speed** for the next game based on past performance

#### 2. ⚡ Real-Time Adaptation (In-Game)

* Tracks the last **15 shots** (hit = 1, miss = 0)
* Computes rolling accuracy continuously
* Adjusts alien speed dynamically:

  * High accuracy → speed increases
  * Low accuracy → speed decreases

#### 3. ⏳ Stability Mechanisms

* Cooldown system prevents rapid difficulty changes
* Speed is clamped within safe limits

---

**Result:**

> The game adapts both **between sessions** and **during gameplay**, creating a smoother and more personalized challenge.
